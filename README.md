# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning application** that predicts flight ticket prices based on real-world travel details such as airline, source, destination, stops, timing, duration, and days left before departure.

The goal of this project is not just prediction accuracy, but to demonstrate **how a machine learning model is built, packaged, and deployed safely for real users**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Predicts flight prices in real-time
- Uses a **preprocessing + model pipeline** (no manual encoding)
- Desktop-like **Streamlit web application**
- Dark mode toggle
- Live price trend visualization
- Cloud deployable (Streamlit Cloud)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Model**: Random Forest Regression  
- **Pipeline**:  
  - Categorical encoding  
  - Feature preprocessing  
  - Model training combined in a single pipeline  
- **Why Pipeline?**  
  Ensures the same transformations are applied during training and prediction, avoiding data leakage and deployment issues.
